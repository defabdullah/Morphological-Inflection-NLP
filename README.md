# Morphological-Inflection-NLP
This repository hosts the "English Verb Tense Transformer," a machine learning project focused on transforming English verbs from their base form to their past tense using a fine-tuned model. This project is inspired by approaches typically used in morphological transformation tasks, adapted here for the English language.
